# Frontend Mentor - Easybank landing page solution

This is my solution to the [Easybank landing page challenge on Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/easybank-landing-page-WaUhkoDN). Frontend Mentor challenges help you improve your coding skills by building realistic projects.

**NOTE: I did not have access to the Figma/Sketch file, so the design is far from being pixel perfect.**
